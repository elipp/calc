calc:

Calculator application. Written in C.

Supports parsing of general mathematical expressions with user-defined 
constants (variables). The chemistry suite is on the way.

dependencies: the GNU readline library (recommended); however, 
              the readline replacement library (vt100_readline_emul)
	      may be used instead, but bugs are guaranteed to exist.
	      Also, the full feature-set of the GNU readline library
	      is not supported.

	      (see Makefile!) 

	      C99 for strtold (only with -DLONG_DOUBLE_PRECISION)
