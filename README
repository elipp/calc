calc:

Calculator application. Written in C.

Supports parsing of general mathematical expressions with user-defined 
constants (variables). The chemistry suite is on the way.

dependencies: 

 - the GNU readline library (recommended). However, the provided line-editing
   library (dubbed "vt100_readline_emul") may be used as a replacement *.

 - A C99-standard compliant C-library for strtold (only with -DLONG_DOUBLE_PRECISION)
	      
	(see Makefile!) 

	* vt100_readline_emul doesn't implement the whole feature-set 
	of the GNU readline library. Also, it's considered untested and unstable.
