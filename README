calc:

Calculator application. Written in C.

Supports parsing of general mathematical expressions
and user-defined constants (variables).

dependencies: the GNU readline library (recommended); 
	      however, the drop-in readline replacement 
	      library (vt100_readline_emul) can be used,
	      but be sure to expect bugs. A lot of them.
	      (see Makefile). It's not a fork of readline.

	      C99 for strtold (only with -DLONG_DOUBLE_PRECISION)
