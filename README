calc:

An interactive command-line calculator. Written in C.

Supports parsing of general mathematical expressions with user-defined 
constants (variables). A chemistry plugin & OpenGL-based plotting will be
implemented in the near future.

Requirements: 

 - the GNU readline library (recommended). However, the provided line-editing
   library (creatively dubbed "rl_emul") may be used as a replacement *.

 - A C99-standard compliant C-library/compiler for strtold (only with -DLONG_DOUBLE_PRECISION) 
	
	(see Makefile!) 

	* rl_emul is basically an interpreter of ANSI (X3.64) escape sequences.
	It is untested/unstable, and doesn't try to implement the whole feature-set 
	of the GNU readline library. Instead, it merely offers similar behaviour and 
	functionality for those who need it (and a nice programming drill for the author :P)
